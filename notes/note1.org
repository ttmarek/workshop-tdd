* First test is an integration test
* Second test is a unit test
* First test checks that both stringLib and formatUsername are working
* Second test checks that formatUsername is using stringLib properly
* Second test is isolating formatUsername's functionality


* ASK: Which of the two do you think is better? Why?
* 1st test --> refactors easier
* 1st test --> easier to switch out stringLib
* 1st test --> simpler
* 1st test --> testing behaviour, not implementation
* 1st test -->  formatUsername like a black box


* ASK: Why is 1st test not perfect? Which principle does it break?
* Testing to many things at once
* ASK: Why is testing more than one thing at once bad?
* Makes refactoring harder
* ASK: What would you do to make it better?
