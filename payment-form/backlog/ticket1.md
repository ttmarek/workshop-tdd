# Ticket 1

As a shopper, I want to enter in my phone number so that I can complete the payment form.

```
As a shopper,
I can enter in my phone number in the payment form
And,
I am prevented from entering in letters
I am prevented from entering in more than 10 digits
I am given on-the-fly phone number formatting as I type
   On the first three digits, no formatting: "123"
   On the fourth digit: "(123) 4"
   On the seventh digit: "(123) 456-7"
   On the tenth digit: "(123) 456-7890"
```

## How can I describe what happened?

## How is the state going to change?

## How do I need to transform the state data for the UI?

## How is the UI going to look given some data?
This is done.
